# Destiny PvP Tracker

## The plan

To fetch and displays basic Destiny character PvP information, and to allow comparison between accounts.

You can see it while it's developed here: https://dry-temple-50978.herokuapp.com/

As this was created as a Ruby on Rails learning project, the aesthetics of the site may be a tad rough.

## Deploying locally or on Heroku

Requires a Destiny API key to be set as an ENV var, or in a application.yml file as "DESTINY_API_KEY"

## Example

To be filled out once created
